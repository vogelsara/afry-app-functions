# AFRY App Functions

This project is part of my technical recruitment task for AFRY.

I created 2 separate repositories for the frontend and backend code. This is the code for the backend. For simplicity I wrote one single README for both repositories. You can find it under the [repository of the client code](https://github.com/vogelsara/afry-test-client).
